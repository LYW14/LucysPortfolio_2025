      CMOVF is a platform built to modernize visuospatial neglect assessments for stroke patients, replacing traditional paper-based exams with a digital solution. 
      As part of a <strong>cross-functional team</strong> of software engineers, UI/UX designers, and our managers collaborating directly with a <strong>cognitive neuroscientist client</strong> who guided requirements in biweekly meetings. 
      I contributed to the <strong>full development cycle</strong> from requirements gathering to deployment. 
      On the engineering side, I worked on implementing the <strong>frontend interface</strong> for clinician-administered assessments, built data capture and storage flows, and integrated the system with a backend designed for longitudinal patient tracking. 
      I also collaborated with the design team to translate clinical workflows into an accessible UI, ensuring the tool was usable for both research and clinical settings. 
      Through this process, we delivered a tool that allows clinicians to record, store, and analyze results quantitatively while giving researchers standardized, data-rich insights to link behavioral and imaging data. 
      The project strengthened my skills in <strong>full-stack development</strong>, <strong>stakeholder communication</strong>, and <strong>teamwork</strong> on a real-world product.

I learned that visualizing a design in my head isnâ€™t enoughâ€”without detailed planning, even small choices (like picking an icon out of hundreds that look similar) became time-consuming and frustrating. This showed me the value of organized, intentional design before coding. I also began exploring branding and theme development, experimenting with design cohesion through metaphors (like the train/public transit theme).',

      medium: 'In an era where digital appearances increasingly mediate social and professional interactions, understanding human perceptions of facial attractiveness has become highly relevant. This project analyzed human perceptions of facial attractiveness using AI-generated faces from NVIDIAâ€™s StyleGAN. Through a web-based rating experiment, ridge regression, and PCA, we mapped how facial attributes relate to perceived beauty and inferred a direction of higher attractiveness. While attractiveness was not a primary source of variance in StyleGANâ€™s latent space, it contributed significantly. Further research with larger, more diverse samples is needed.',

        This project explored the relationship between facial features and perceived attractiveness using AI-generated imagery and human survey data. 
        I built a <strong>web-based experiment in jsPsych</strong>, integrated DataPipe for <strong>backend data storage</strong>, and hosted the project on the Open Science Framework. 
        Participants rated faces generated with NVIDIAâ€™s StyleGAN, and I performed the statistical modeling and machine learning analysis using <strong>Ridge Regression</strong> and <strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong>. 
        The results showed that StyleGANâ€™s latent space encodes a meaningful dimension for attractiveness, suggesting potential for modeling human aesthetic judgments computationally. 
        While limited by a sample size of 1,390 and a participant pool skewed toward university-age individuals, the study demonstrated my ability to combine <strong>frontend experiment design</strong>, <strong>backend integration</strong>, and <strong>quantitative analysis</strong> in a research setting.

        This was my first exposure to <strong>single-cell sequencing</strong>, and I was struck by both the power and the limitations of this technology. 
        This project ended after two years of research when I reached a point where I no longer was able to advance with the needs of the project/technology.
        Remembering that feeling of limitation has pushed me to keep learning new skills so that my curiosity and research wonâ€™t be constrained by the lack of tools. 
        One day, I may even learn the skills to be able to return and complete this project in a more satisfying manner. 
        I also developed public speaking and science communication skills. 
        At science fair competitions, I was able to deliver my presentation using complex language to an audience of field specialists and use simpler language with interested interviewers and peers who had no prior exposure. 
        I learned to balance depth and clarity, using a variety of visuals to make an academic subject engaging and accessible.
